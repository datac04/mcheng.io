Write a paragraph of at least 100 words describing your topic and how it will be presented on the web.

My topic will be a personal portfolio website, showcasing my professional experience, school club leadership, along with my hobby of photography. I’ll split my website into 4 separate web pages, starting with an “about me” page with my name, picture, and a general professional description. Then I’ll have a page about some of my professional experience, including my internship with a company called MLVentures, and also 2 projects I did as part of hackathons, with a paragraph and picture about each experience. Then I’ll have a page detailing my involvement on the executive board of Asian Cultural Union (ACU), the largest Asian cultural club at NYU, with a few pictures and at least 2 paragraphs. Finally, I’ll have a page displaying some of the photographs I took. Each page will be organized with a menu (expandable from a drop down with JS if time allows) at the top with links to each website, and also a return to top button at the bottom. Throughout I’ll also have a few actions on hover of text, such as changing color or emphasizing. I’ll also have some links such as to the NYU website and ACU website.
